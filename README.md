## Introduction

The Scheduling Algorithms Simulation Website is a web application that allows users to simulate various scheduling algorithms commonly used in computer science and operating systems. It provides a user-friendly interface to understand and visualize how different algorithms work and how they schedule processes or tasks.

The website includes simulations for the following scheduling algorithms:
1. Round Robin
2. Banker's Algorithm
3. MRU (Most Recently Used) Algorithm
4. Scan/C-Scan Algorithm

## Features

- Simulate and visualize the behavior of different scheduling algorithms.
- Customize simulation parameters such as time quantum for Round Robin, available resources for Banker's Algorithm, etc.
- Real-time updates of the simulation to provide an interactive experience.
- View detailed statistics for each algorithm's execution.
- Intuitive user interface for easy navigation.

## Technologies Used

The project was built using the following technologies:

- ExpressJS: A web application framework for Node.js, used to handle server-side functionality.
- HTML/CSS: For creating the structure and styling of the website.
- JavaScript: To implement interactive features and algorithm simulations on the client-side.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and retrieve simulation data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/scheduling-algorithms.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd scheduling-algorithms`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your machine.
2. Start the application: `npm start` or `node app.js`
3. Open your web browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`
4. Explore the website and select the desired scheduling algorithm to simulate.
5. Customize simulation parameters as required and start the simulation.
6. View the visualization of the algorithm's execution and the associated statistics.
